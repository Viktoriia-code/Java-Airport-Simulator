# Java Airport Simulator (3-phase simulation)

This is a Maven-based Java simulation for airport systems, designed to model and analyze airport operations in a controlled, virtual environment using a 3-phase model. It uses a <a href="https://www.dcs.ed.ac.uk/home/simjava/distributions/doc/eduni/distributions/package-summary.html">distribution package from The University of Edinburgh</a> to model events like passenger arrivals, check-ins, security checks, border control and boarding. The project provides a complete framework for setting up, managing, and analyzing the flow of passengers and queues within an airport environment.

The simulation helps optimize airport layouts, passenger flow, aircraft movements, and resource management, ensuring efficiency and scalability.
